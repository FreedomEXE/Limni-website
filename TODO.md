## COT + Sentiment Expansion (Data-Only First)
- Track full 63‑symbol universe (44 FX + 19 non‑FX) in research only.
- Keep new symbols **data-only** (not tradable) until graduation.
- Graduation rule proposal:
  - 8–12 consecutive weeks of COT + sentiment.
  - No missing data in last 4 weeks.
  - Volatility/spread sanity checks.
- Add gating flag so research can include all 63 without affecting performance/live trading.
