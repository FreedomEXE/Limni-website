# Current Work

Status: active checklist. Keep this short and update it when gates change.

Persistent memory stays in
`C:/Users/User/Documents/GitHub/freedom-ops/.codex/`; this file tracks the
current Limni work plan so Freedom does not have to reconstruct it from chat.

## Active Gate

Gate 58C: forced28-cot-strength-directional-arbitration.

Objective: convert the Gate 58 COT x Strength forensic matrix into a small,
predeclared set of full-surface directional systems, forcing exactly `28` pair
decisions per supported week over the `373`-week Strength/COT intersection.

Status: complete and stopped. Gate 58C used only the existing Gate 58 matrix and
warehouse long/short outcomes. It did not run raw M1 simulation, write app code,
change COT source logic, change Strength windows/source, add row vetoes, skip
pair-weeks, add eligibility filters, exclude pairs/calendar periods, introduce
regimes, risk overlays, execution changes, market-open confirmation, new
thresholds, new buckets, or parameter searches. Validation: `10,444` rows,
`373` full weeks, `28` symbols per week, `0` duplicate week/symbol rows, `0`
missing COT rows, `0` missing Strength rows, `20,888` warehouse directional rows
read, and `0` missing warehouse outcomes. Durable report:
`docs/research/gates/gate58c/GATE58C_FORCED28_COT_STRENGTH_DIRECTIONAL_ARBITRATION_LOCK_TEST_2026-06-27.md`.
Tracked SHA identity:
`docs/research/gates/gate58c/artifacts/gate58c-forced28-directional-arbitration/gate58c-forced28-directional-arbitration.sha256.txt`.

Verdict: `PASS_FORCED_28_DIRECTIONAL_LOCK`. Gate 58C is accepted as provisional
Alpha v1 for forward comparison, not permanent Strength endorsement. The unique
lock candidate is `C_STRENGTH_HEALTHY_COT_FALLBACK`: use Gate 57E Strength for
`compressed:persistent`, `compressed:flip`, and `middle:persistent`; otherwise
fall back to locked COT. Candidate D collapses to the same row-level decisions
as Candidate C and is reported as a duplicate, not a second lock. Candidate C
metrics: ADR Grid `1648.2508`, DD `-312.0722`, R/DD `5.2816`, PF `1.1643`,
Weekly Hold ADR `534.3663`, top-five absolute week share `0.0773`, top absolute
pair share `0.0844`, `1` negative year with worst year `2019` at `-32.5370`,
and top positive lifecycle x phase delta from `compressed:flip` (`835` rows,
`343` weeks, `+215.4996` ADR Grid vs COT), so the lock screen does not depend
on a tiny cell. COT full `388`-week metrics remain reported separately from the
direct `373`-week comparison window.

Alpha v1 governance: `ALPHA_V1_COT_PARENT_STRENGTH_HEALTHY_FALLBACK` is frozen
as the current forced-28 directional comparison baseline. Strength remains
provisional signal debt; the PF caveat is real; no silent Strength retuning,
removal, or replacement is allowed inside Regime, risk, execution, MT5/live, or
app gates. Future Strength change must be a new versioned research gate compared
against COT-only, Alpha v1, Regime-only forced-28 shadow signal when available,
and future Alpha v2 arbitration candidates. Alpha layers force 28; risk and
portfolio layers may later reduce expression, but the shadow ledger must retain
all 28 signal outcomes.

## Next Requested Review

Stop after Gate 58C. Do not proceed to regimes, risk overlays, execution work,
MT5/live, app work, or cleanup in the same run. After Gate 58C packaging/push,
the next permitted research gate is Gate 59: Alpha v1 atom ledger contract.

## Current Ownership Model

- `app/` keeps only app runtime, public assets, release evidence, and app config.
- `engine/` owns reusable local institutional research/backtest source code,
  commands, cached data, and generated engine reports.
- `database/` owns neutral DB access used by app server code and engine code.
- `automation/` owns MT5 assets, bots, sentiment scraper, voice helpers, and
  Playwright automation.
- `archive/` owns stale historical reports, research workspaces, and one-off
  scripts mirrored by original path.

## Gate 56 Checklist

- Move tracked `app/reports`, `app/research`, `app/scripts`, `app/services`, and
  `app/tests` out of active `app/`.
- Flatten the old nested reports archive content into
  `archive/app/reports/legacy`.
- Keep only forward reusable research command surface under `engine/`.
- Keep MT5/bots/scraper/voice/test automation under `automation/`.
- Patch package scripts, workflows, ignores, docs, and local path defaults to the
  new layout.
- Verify no tracked active app files remain under `app/reports`, `app/research`,
  `app/scripts`, `app/services`, or `app/tests`.
- Do not run new Strength bucket tests, regime filters, COT+Strength tests,
  execution optimization, or research-engine rebuilds in this cleanup gate.

## Gate 56B Checklist

- Inventory every tracked file under `app/src/lib`.
- Move engine-owned manifest/evaluator/hash/registry code to
  `engine/src/research`.
- Move local M1 warehouse ownership to `engine/src/price`.
- Move research matrix and macro warehouse helpers to `engine/src/warehouse`.
- Archive obvious unreferenced stale app-lib leftovers under root `archive/`.
- Keep deprecated but referenced app research UI/API support under
  `app/src/lib/research` until a later app refactor gate.
- Document boundary debt instead of extracting shared DB/path primitives in this
  gate.

## Gate 56C Checklist

- Move the real DB client from `app/src/lib/db.ts` to
  `database/db/client.ts`.
- Move the root env loader from `app/src/lib/server/rootEnv.ts` to
  `database/db/rootEnv.ts`.
- Leave app compatibility re-exports at the old app paths.
- Patch engine DB imports to `@database/db/client`.
- Remove the engine local M1 adapter dependency on app repo-path helpers.
- Mark app `backtestEngine.ts` as deprecated mock visualization debt.
- Do not run new research tests or strategy variants.

## Gate 56D Checklist

- Move runtime cache ownership to `engine/src/cache/runtimeCache.ts`.
- Move COT market constants and week-anchor helpers to `engine/src/contracts`.
- Move canonical price bars/windows, ADR lookup, path resolution, and path bar
  loading to `engine/src/price`.
- Move execution weekly window helpers to `engine/src/evaluation`.
- Leave compatibility re-exports at the old `app/src/lib/*` paths.
- Prove `engine/src` and `engine/scripts` contain no `@/lib/` imports.
- Do not run Gate 55G parity, new research variants, Strength buckets, or regime
  filters in this cleanup gate.

## Forward Research Command

After Gate 56E parity, the shared engine evaluator entry point is:

```powershell
npm run engine:research-manifest:evaluate -- --manifest=<manifest.json> --artifact-gate=gate55 --price-bundle-id=gate55e_fx_m1_oanda_ny5_v1_20181217_20260607_8E37E953 --path-resolution=1m --evaluators=adr_grid,weekly_hold --status=diagnostic
```

For multi-manifest ladders, repeat `--manifest=<path>` in the same command to
use Gate 57A0 week-major batch mode.

For fast manifest aggregation over the durable Gate 57A0B path-outcome
warehouse, add the explicit warehouse ID. This mode validates the warehouse and
fails closed if rows are missing or hash-invalid; it does not silently rerun M1
path simulation:

```powershell
npm run engine:research-manifest:evaluate -- --manifest=<manifest.json> --artifact-gate=gate57 --price-bundle-id=gate55e_fx_m1_oanda_ny5_v1_20181217_20260607_8E37E953 --path-resolution=1m --evaluators=adr_grid,weekly_hold --status=diagnostic --path-outcome-warehouse-id=gate57a0b_pair_week_path_outcomes_47B8F40AFB3B
```
