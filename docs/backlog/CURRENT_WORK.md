# Current Work

Status: active checklist. Keep this short and update it when gates change.

This is the running repo-visible checklist. Persistent memory stays in
`C:/Users/User/Documents/GitHub/freedom-ops/.codex/`; this file tracks the
current Limni work plan so Freedom does not have to reconstruct it from chat.

## Workflow

- Use at most three active running surfaces:
  - `CODEX_SESSION.md` for hot recovery and frozen areas.
  - `docs/backlog/CURRENT_WORK.md` for the active checklist.
  - One focused gate/release doc only when the active gate needs durable detail.
- Archive completed or stale notes under `archive/` using mirrored repo paths.
- Do not start coding until the active gate is named.
- For broad issue sets, classify first, then patch one gate at a time.
- Gate labels use a sequence number plus a scope slug. The slug is the real
  boundary; the number is only a recovery handle.

## Active Gate

Gate 28: versioning-documents-popover.

Goal:

- Make future version updates behave and look the same in Documents.
- Align v1 and v2 document/release structure so old versions do not drift into
  a separate pattern.
- Simplify the version popover to current live and next dev version only.
- Keep runtime version truth to `liveVersion` and `devVersion`; do not use
  `pendingRelease` as UI truth.
- Inspect existing docs/code first, then patch narrowly.

## Next Gates

1. Weekly Hold engine verification.
2. ADR Grid data-truth audit.

## Active Context

- Version UI should use `liveVersion` and `devVersion` only.
- Current live version is `2.0.3`.
- `pendingRelease` must not be runtime UI truth or visible as a separate
  runtime state.
- Documents/release docs should use one simple structure across versions.
- Version popover should be compact: live is the current public version; dev is
  the new working version.
- Data page baseline copy should be derived from data/config, not hardcoded or
  release-branded.
- Weekly Hold manual checks mostly matched the indicator, but the repo still
  needs its own reproducible proof path.
- ADR Grid is the major app-vs-indicator blocker: fills, TP counts, returns,
  drawdowns, basket counts, and recent-vs-stored week behavior need audit.
- Strategy work is three layers: baseline/data direction, ADR Grid execution,
  and risk management.
- Do not optimize trading logic until current numbers are trusted.
